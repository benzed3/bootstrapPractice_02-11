        <p id="G54">Godzilla (1954)</p>
        <p>
            What can be said about the original 1954 Godzilla? The film is simply a masterpiece. Ishiro Honda’s film
            begun what is now the longest running film franchise, also with the most films, with 37 to date with one
            slated for next year, 2024. The acting and special effects are corny and not up to our current
            standards,
            but it still happens to be a great film. The first time I saw this, I was impressed with how well they
            did
            with the special effects, considering the limitations back then. Godzilla still appeared menacing. The
            destruction is apparent. The practical effects remained for many years, but they have worked. Well, at
            least
            for this film it works really well. The acting may be a little dramatic by our standards, but it still
            drives the point. Not until the recent Godzilla Minus One (Gojira Mainasu Wan in Japan) has a movie
            about a
            giant monster been engaging. Sure, the other Godzilla films are fun to watch, but that is all they have
            been: just some monster fighting action.
            Godzilla has as its theme the dangers of nuclear weapons, with Godzilla being symbolic of the potential
            destruction of nuclear arms. Created from nuclear bombs dropped by the United States in Japan, Godzilla
            is a
            mutated prehistoric animal. On the fictional Odo island, local legend tells of how innocent girls were
            given
            and fed to ward of Godzilla. So only on this island is Godzilla known. That is, until he attacks random
            fishing boats off Japanese waters. Strange disasters also occur on Odo Island, caused by Godzilla. This
            leads research scientists to Odo island to investigate the source of these attacks, and there those
            scientists encounter Godzilla. The shot, with Godzilla’s head seen sticking up behind the hills, is
            classic.
            This is the first view in the film of Godzilla. The researchers, in fear, follow Godzilla, but find that
            he
            has returned to the ocean’s waters.
            At a conference, lead scientist, archaeologist Dr. Kyohei Yamane, explains Godzilla’s origins. The
            conference ends in a fight of whether to tell the public or not. Godzilla attacks around Tokyo Bay, but
            he
            is warded off by planes. Preparations for the next attack are made. This next time, Godzilla attacks
            full
            force, causing utter destruction. All the preparations made to stop him fail.
            After the destruction, the devastation caused by Godzilla’s attack are clearly seen, as is the way
            people
            are coping with it. Emiko, Yamane’s daughter, breaks Serisawa’s trust, but for good reason. She, along
            with
            her boyfriend, plead with Serisawa. At first he says no, but seeing the destruction caused by Godzilla,
            he
            decides to use the oxygen destroyer, but burns and gets rid of any plans to prevent another one from
            being
            built.
            Off at sea, Godzilla is found using a Geiger counter. Serisawa convines Ogata to let him go down with
            him
            into the ocean, since he is the only one to use the oxygen destroyer. Ogata reluctantly agrees. Once
            down,
            Serisawa sends Ogata back to the surface, sets off the oxygen destroyer, which kills Godzilla and
            himself.
            Those on the boat mourn Serisawa and his sacrifice. Godzilla is dead, but at great cost.
